# FrostyToolsuite_Light_Theme
Light Theme for the FrostyToolsuite

currently compatible with v1.0.6.1 release @ https://github.com/CadeEvs/FrostyToolsuite/releases

I take no credit for any of the files stored in this repository. I only edited them from the freely available source code (available at the above link)
to create a suitable light theme for the frosty editor, mod manager and other ui elements.

inspired by vs 2019's light theme.

1. download source code from the above link.
2. make sure you have visual studio 2019 installed
3. set configuration in visual studio 2019 to match the screenshot file on this repo.
4. download and install .net sdk 5.0.408
5. build each project one by one.
6. make mods!
