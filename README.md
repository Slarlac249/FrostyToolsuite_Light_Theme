# FrostyToolsuite_Light_Theme
Light Theme for the FrostyToolsuite

currently compatible with v1.0.6.1 release @ https://github.com/CadeEvs/FrostyToolsuite/releases

I take no credit for any of the files stored in this repository. I only edited them from the freely available source code (available at the above link)
to create a suitable light theme for the frosty editor, mod manager and other ui elements.

only the edited files are shared here, not the full source code.

inspired by vs 2019's light theme.

1. download source code from the above link and extract somewhere suitable.
2. download the edited files from this repo and replace the files in the extracted 1.0.6.1 source code.
3. make sure you have visual studio 2019 installed (you can find the community edition as it's free) see selection of screenshots for required installation configuration.
4. set configuration in visual studio 2019 (with solution loaded) to match the "vs_2019_build_configuration.png" screenshot file on this repo.
5. download and install .net sdk 5.0.408 @ https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0
6. you should now be setup and able to build each project one by one.
7. make mods!
